Project Status: Startup
Code Status: Some Exploratory Code implemented in HDL's, SystemC, C++, Haskell

Original Codename: Combinator 

Now Renamed To: 

  H^2 or hsq == Haskell on Hardware - translation to rtl verilog and vhdl for fpga implementation

  Scala is progressing - using an fpga-based jvm coult provide a quick path to embedded use of this Hybrid Language
  
Some experiments that involve emulating long shift registers in block ram to simulate multiple serial stream processing.

Manually developed verilog, systemc, vhdl and system verilog code fragments will be uploaded by end of January 2013

An attempt to provide a quantum or optical 'feel' using structures that directly map haskell onto fpga device features.

Altera Quartus II webpack supports a growing subset of SystemVerilog Module Features which will be utilized in subsequent
versions of code fragments. Other development tools (ForSyDe, Vivaldo, etc) will be evaluated for use as back end tools.

Currently experimenting with Altera Qsys, verilator, and systemc. 
Have also experiment with Xilinx ise and Lattice Diamond

Dev Kits:
  Avnet Spartan 3 Evaluation Kit
  Altera Cyclone III FPGA Starter Kit
  Lattice ECP3 Development Kit
  Lattice MachXO2 Kit
  
This has been hard to pull together because:
  Technology keeps advancing and I am a perfectionist who thinks we should already have warp drive and transporter technology in place!
